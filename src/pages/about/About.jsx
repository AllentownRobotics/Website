          <h1>Our Story</h1>
          <p>Twelve years ago, our founder, Chris Nalbone, had a goal.  He wanted to start a First Robotics Team in Allentown High School in order to create an activity his son could partake in and enjoy. However, Mr. Nalbone did more than that; he created a community in Allentown High School diverse in skills and hobbies, but unified in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Mathematics).</p>
          <p>In Mr. Nalboneâ€™s book, he discusses the steps neccesary in achieving his goal, as well as the success of FRC Team 1807: Redbird Robotics. Below is a PDF of the book, which provides the history and reasons our robotics team was created.</p>
